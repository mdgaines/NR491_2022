    "The PlanetScope satellite constellation consists of multiple launches of groups of individual “small-satellites” (~200+ in total). Planet's on-orbit capacity is constantly improving in capability or quantity, with technology improvements deployed at a rapid pace. Each PlanetScope satellite is a CubeSat 3U form factor (10 cm by 10 cm by 30 cm). The complete PlanetScope is able to image the entire Earth every day (equating to a daily collection capacity of ~200 million km²/day).\n",

    "*\"The PlanetScope Analytic Ortho Tile product is orthorectified, multispectral data from the satellite constellation. Analytic products are calibrated multispectral imagery products that have been processed to allow analysts to derive information products for data science and analytics. This product is designed for a wide variety of applications that require imagery with an accurate geolocation and cartographic projection. It has been processed to remove distortions caused by terrain and can be used for many data science and analytic applications. It eliminates the perspective effect on the ground (not on buildings), restoring the geometry of a vertical shot. The orthorectified visual imagery is optimal for value-added image processing including vegetation indices, land cover classifications, etc. In addition to orthorectification, the imagery has radiometric corrections applied to correct for any sensor artifacts and transformation to at- sensor radiance.\"*\n",
